These experiments studies the Rutherford scattering of protons on atomic nuclei. Energetic 400 keV protons were generated using a Van de Graaff accelerator and directed onto thin metal foils of Au/C, LiF, B, and Al and the scattering cross section of the target atoms was measured as a function of the scattering angle in the range xx to 160 degrees. The cross section showed a clear angular dependency as ....., as expected. 
The thickness of the target layers Au/C were determined from the stopping power of the layers to be ..... The nuclear reactions of protons with boron were demonstrated by ...
