\section{Introduction} 
Almost all of our knowledge in the field of nuclear and atomic physics has been
discovered through scattering experiments, and the theory of scattering underpins
one of the most ubiquitous tools in physics.
Even more, in low energy physics, scattering phenomena provide the standard tool to
explore solid state systems. Historically, this was used as a first step
towards our current understanding of the atom.


This paper examines the Rutherford scattering of a beam of $\SI{400}{\kilo\electronvolt}$
protons with a $\mathrm{Au}$/$\mathrm{C}$ solid target. To limit the extend of
the paper, and to keep our discussion simple and relevant, we will only examine
elastic collisions in the semi-classical regime, governed by the Sommerfeld
critcriterion for classical scattering. \parencite[p. 14]{noteBB}

This is usually fine for low energy physics, in which internal energies remain
constant and no further particles are created or annihilated.
For our experiment, which involves a single Van-de-Graaff accelerator with
energies of the order of $\SI{400}{\kilo\electronvolt}$, this will be a very
fine approximation.
